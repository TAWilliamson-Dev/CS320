How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By performing a requirements analysis early, clearly defining what the software is supposed to achieve. Creating a comprehensive 
testing strategy including both manual and automatic unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests.
Conducting regular code reviews, ensuring that new additions to the codebase meet the expected requirements, catch and resolve 
defects in the software and maintain thestandards present within the application. Another important step is ensuring that my code
is secure, preventing both the common vulnerabilities and ideally any unexpected / new vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

First by conducting user research through interviews, surveys, and observation to gain insights into the users behaviors, preferences,
and pain points. Next, create User stories that follow expected use cases for the software and conduct both development and testing along
with those user stories. By creating a feedback loop with users, we can ensure that we have up to date information about how the user is
feeling with the software, refine our understanding of their expectations, and improve the software iteratively.

How do I approach designing software?

First I approach problems creatively and iteratively, with a focus on user needs. Then through creating the appropriate software architecture,
with the best framework and most applicable design patterns I can ensure that the software remains scalable, maintainable, and performant. Maintain
loose coupling and tight cohesion throughout the system, ensuring that changes to any one piece of the software does not introduce unnecessary tech
debt and require more extensive refactoring / rewrites of existing code.
